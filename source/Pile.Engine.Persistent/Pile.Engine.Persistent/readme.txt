Installation

To recompile the sources for the persistent Pile engine on your machine, 
you need to download and install VistaDb 3.x first.
A free trial edition is available:
http://download.vistadb.net/TrialA.aspx

After installation of VistaDb copy the VistaDB.NET20.dll database runtime file 
into the the Pile.Engine.Persistent\lib folder.
The VS.NET project references it from there.
